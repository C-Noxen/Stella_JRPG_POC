# Constraints
- Output is a structured spec (no code changes yet).
- Loop phases are Declare -> Commit -> Resolve -> Recover (exactly 4).
- Commitment types: Instant / Charged / Channeled.
- Disruption degrades output; committed skills resolve unless a unit is defeated.
- Keep scope to the battle loop only.

## Non-goals
- Full game design
- UI implementation
- Networking or multiplayer
- Phase-1 content counts (classes/skills/arenas/items)
- Enemy roles or encounter design
