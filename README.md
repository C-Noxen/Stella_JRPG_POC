# Stella JRPG POC
Goal: a small proof-of-concept for a 4-phase JRPG/Yu-Gi-Oh inspired battle loop.

Core loop (exact 4 phases):
- Declare -> Commit -> Resolve -> Recover

Commitment types:
- Instant / Charged / Channeled

Disruption rule:
- Disruption degrades output; committed skills resolve unless a unit is defeated.
